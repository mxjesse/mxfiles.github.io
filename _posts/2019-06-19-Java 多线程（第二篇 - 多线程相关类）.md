## Java 多线程（第二篇 - 多线程相关类）

### 多线程应用场景
1. 通过并行计算提高性能
2. 等待网络，I/O响应导致的耗时问题
3. 

### 基本线程类
Java基本线程类指的是Thread类，Runnable接口和Callable接口。

#### Thread类   
  源码如下：
  
  ```
  public class Thread implements Runnable {
  
  		private volatile String name;
  		private int priority;
  		
  		/**
	     * A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield
	     * its current use of a processor. The scheduler is free to ignore this
	     * hint.
	     *
	     * <p> Yield is a heuristic attempt to improve relative progression
	     * between threads that would otherwise over-utilise a CPU. Its use
	     * should be combined with detailed profiling and benchmarking to
	     * ensure that it actually has the desired effect.
	     *
	     * <p> It is rarely appropriate to use this method. It may be useful
	     * for debugging or testing purposes, where it may help to reproduce
	     * bugs due to race conditions. It may also be useful when designing
	     * concurrency control constructs such as the ones in the
	     * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks} package.
	     */
	    public static native void yield(); // 让出当前线程的CPU控制权，让别的Runnable状态的线程运行
	    
	     /**
	     * Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
	     * execution) for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to
	     * the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread
	     * does not lose ownership of any monitors.
	     *
	     * @param  millis
	     *         the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
	     *
	     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
	     *          if the value of {@code millis} is negative
	     *
	     * @throws  InterruptedException
	     *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
	     *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
	     *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
	     */
	    public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException;//使当前线程，
	    //暂停一段时间，不释放线程获得的锁
	    
	    /**
	     * Waits for this thread to die.
	     *
	     * <p> An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
	     * way as the invocation
	     *
	     * <blockquote>
	     * {@linkplain #join(long) join}{@code (0)}
	     * </blockquote>
	     *
	     * @throws  InterruptedException
	     *          if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
	     *          <i>interrupted status</i> of the current thread is
	     *          cleared when this exception is thrown.
	     */
	    public final void join() throws InterruptedException {//在一个线程中调用other.join(),
	    //将等待other执行完后才继续本线程。
	        join(0);
	    }
	    
	    public void interrupt() {//可以打断sleep()或join()状态
	        if (this != Thread.currentThread())
	            checkAccess();
	
	        synchronized (blockerLock) {
	            Interruptible b = blocker;
	            if (b != null) {
	                interrupt0();   //native方法        // Just to set the interrupt flag
	                b.interrupt(this);
	                return;
	            }
	        }
	        interrupt0();
	    }
  }
  ```
  
  * interrupt()方法最终调用的是一个native方法，它实际上是将当前线程的`interrupted`状态标识为true，此时调用isInterrupted()方法能得到返回值为true，否则为false
  
#### Runnable接口

#### Callable，future
